# Prerequisites
C++


# Usage
We provide two cases for MNE:
1. FB15K: [FreeBase][2]
2. WN18: [WordNet][3]

and there are six files for each case (zipped the data to meet the space limit):
- `MNE.cpp`: The MNE model for embedding
- `data for embedding.zip`: The dataset for embedding training
- `data for link prediction.zip`: The dataset for link prediction
- `data for triplet classification.zip`: The dataset for triplet classification

# Note
The output files will be stored in `./result ` directory during embedding training.
